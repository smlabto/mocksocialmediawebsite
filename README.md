# ModSimulator

ModSimulator is an open-source tool that simulates an interactive social media timeline, designed for experimental research on the effectiveness of content moderation interventions. It enables researchers to test specific soft content moderation measures, such as displaying fact-check warnings in the footnotes or adding blur screens. These measures are commonly used by social media platforms to limit the spread of misinformation and to inform users about the accuracy of claims.

With ModSimulator, researchers can create and customize an interactive social media timeline that closely resembles a real-world social media platform, and they can choose which posts in the timeline will have fact-check warnings in the footnotes or blur screens.

ModSimulator is a customized fork of the [Mock Social Media Website Tool](https://docs.studysocial.media).
